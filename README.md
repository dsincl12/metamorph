# Agentic Tool Exploration in Go

A small exploration of agentic tool usage using Go. Parts of the project have been written by the agent itself. 

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven development, showcasing how an agent can:
- Write and modify code
- Use development tools
- Evolve a project with minimal human intervention

> ðŸ’¡ Given the proper directions, the project can continue to evolve â€“ your imagination (and wallet) is the limit! ðŸ˜‰
